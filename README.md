ðŸ“¦ File Weight Analyzer 

Welcome to this lightweight and useful tool designed to help you better understand the structure and size of your project files.

ðŸ§  About the Project

This project provides a simple yet powerful utility that scans a specified directory and reports the size (or "weight") of every file it contains. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you're looking to optimize your codebase and analyze where your storage is being used.

Whether you're working on a large application or a smaller personal project, this script can offer valuable insight into your directory's composition.

ðŸš€ How to Use

To get started, just run this bad boy and add the path on the terminal when you are asked to do it. Once the path is set, the script will be executed and it will automatically calculate and display the size of each file within that directory.

ðŸ›  Use Case

Use this tool as part of your performance optimization process. Identifying large or unnecessary files can help you reduce bundle sizes, improve load times, and maintain a cleaner project structure overall.
